## Installaion

>[!WARNING]
>I am aware that mistakes and errors are inevitable, especially in a complex project like Fluttermux. I am committed to fixing any errors that are found. I ask for your understanding and patience as I work to improve Fluttermux. In the meantime, I recommend that you update and upgrade Termux before trying to install Fluttermux. This will help to ensure that Fluttermux runs smoothly and without errors.

Run Installer:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bdloser404/Fluttermux/main/install.sh)"
```

## Intialize Your First Project
Once the installation is complete, you can start creating Flutter apps by running the following command:
```
fluttermux --create myapp 
```

Now Build Debug App:
```
flutter build apk --debug
```
It will download and setup gradle Then you are ready for build your dream app.

>[!WARNING]
> Gradle task may take 15-20 min for first time. (depending on your network speed)

Run app Web Mode:
```

flutter run -d web-server --web-port=8000
```
>[!IMPORTANT]
>The `fluttermux --fix gradle` command is very important. You need to run this command every time you create a new Flutter project with `flutter create <project>`. This command fixes the permissions for the gradlew executable, updates the Gradle wrapper distribution URL to support JDK 19, and sets the Gradle property for using aapt2 (aarch64).

## Usage
Fluttermux provides a set of commands and options to help you manage your Flutter environment efficiently. Here are the key options available:

`--create <task>`: This  option allows you to create flutter project. its equivalent to `flutter create <appname>` but then it will fix your project for gradle support.
```
fluttermux --create blogapp
```

`--patch <task>`: Use this option to manually patch specific components of your Flutter environment, such as SDK, Dart, Flutter, or Java. For example, to patch the SDK, you can run:
```
fluttermux --patch sdk
```

`--fix <task>`: If you encounter issues with Gradle, Flutter, or other components, you can use this option to fix them. For instance, to fix Flutter and ensure proper permissions, use:
``` 
fluttermux --fix flutter
 ```

`--ide`: This option allows you to install a Flutter IDE for a more integrated development experience.
you can simply run:
```
fluttermux --ide
```

>[!NOTE]
> IDE is configured by default.

`--uninstall`: If you ever want to remove Fluttermux from your system, you can simply run:
```
fluttermux --uninstall
```

`--help`: If you need a quick reference to the available options and their usage, use the --help option.use:
```
fluttermux --help
```

## How TO Connect ADB Devices

### Get ADB IP

In VMOS, navigate to "Settings" within the virtual Android environment.

- Scroll down and find "Master Setting."

- Inside "Master Setting," look for "ADB Connect `IP:Port`." You will see an IP address and port number, for example, `192.168.0.100:5667`.

- Now, your VMOS Android environment is ready to be connected via ADB using the provided IP address and port number (`192.168.X.X:5667` in this example).

</p>

You can use these methods to perform ADB actions on Termux

### Connect to ADB (VMOS)

from Termux, use:
```
adb connect 192.168.X.X:5667
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Use your ADB `ip:port` instead of `192.168.X.X:5667`

## Connect to ADB (Wireless Debugging Android 11+)

### Step 1: Enable Wireless Debugging on Your Android Device

- Open the "Settings" app on your Android device.
- Scroll down and select "Developer options." If you don't see this option, you can enable it by tapping on "About phone" and then tapping on the "Build number" seven times.
- Inside "Developer options," scroll down and find "Wireless Debugging." Enable it.

Follow below screenshot to get pair addess:

  <img src="https://github.com/bdloser404/Fluttermux/blob/main/img/pair_code.png" width="30%" />
  
</p>

Now pair from Termux:
```
adb pair 192.168.x.x:41xxx
```
Check Connected ADB devices:
```
flutter devices
```
>[!NOTE]
>Make Sure Atlest One Device is Connected Before Running `flutter run`

### Run Flutter App With Connected Devices

Use your ADB address to run FLutter app
```
flutter run -d 192.168.X.X:5667
```
Or you can use devices name:
```
flutter run -d "moto g9 play"
```
